The notebooks belong to a two part project:
The first (defectsPrediction.ipynb) relates to the classification of software project defects based on a series of csv files related to projects and their versions.
The second project (demintiaClassificationCNN.ipynb) deals with multiclass classification of dementia status in Alzheimer's patients using CT images as inputs.

Different types of machine learning algorithms were used to model these problems successfully, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), support vector machines (SVM) and Logistic regression. Data preprocessing is done prior to running the experiments.

Data used in this project is kept private as permission was not requested for sharing them.

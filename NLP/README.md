This project utilizes Arabic language tweets and YouTube comments to predict hatespeech by building several models and comparing them using Spark.
Neural Networks were not used for the task as the project was explicitly targeting the use of spark and its distributed nature.
spark doesn't have the abundance of tools provided in libraries like TensorFlow for training DNN.
